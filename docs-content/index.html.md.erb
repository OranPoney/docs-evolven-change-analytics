This documentation describes the Evolven Change Analytics Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The 
Evolven Change Analytics Service Broker for PCF collects inventory and configuration of the PCF platform and the
applications running on the platform. It detects changes, drift, and inconsistencies in the collected inventory 
and configuration identifying ones that have caused or might cause performance and availability issues in PCF 
applications and the environment. 


## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The Evolven Change Analytics Service Broker for PCF includes a configuration collector that connects to PCF and 
regularly scans the platform and applications running on it for changes, drift, and inconsistencies
in the configuration. The Service Broker reports the collected data to a central Evolven Analytics Server that 
consolidates, cleans, correlates, and analyzes all the information collected by the Service Broker in PCF. 
Users can then access the Evolven Analytics Server to interactively review detected changes and differences, 
their risks, impact, and correlation to the investigated issues. In addition to interactive analysis, the users can
set up alerts, reports, and other types of notifications to be generated by the Evolven Change Analytics Server
when risky changes or drift are detected in a particular PCF cluster or across multiple clusters and environments.
