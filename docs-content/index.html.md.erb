The Evolven Change Analytics Service Broker for PCF includes a configuration collector connecting to PCF and 
regularly scanning the platform and applications running on it. The Service Broker reports collected data and 
detected changes to a central Evolven Analytics Server that consolidates, cleans, correlates and analyzes all 
the collected information. 
Users can access the Evolven Analytics Server to interactively review detected changes and differences, their 
risks, impact and correlation to investigated issues. In addition to interactive analysis the users can set up 
alerts, reports and other types of notifications to be generated by the Evolven Change Analytics Server. The 
reports will be sent when a risky changes or drift is detected in a particular PCF environment or 
across multiple environments.
