The Evolven Change Analytics agent for PCF includes a configuration collector that connects to PCF and 
regularly scans the platform and applications running on it. The agent reports collected data and 
detected changes to a central Evolven Change Analytics Server that consolidates, cleans, correlates, and analyzes all 
the collected information. 

Users can access the Evolven Change Analytics Server to interactively review detected changes and differences, their 
risks, impact, and correlation to investigated issues. In addition to interactive analysis the users can set up 
alerts, reports, and other types of notifications to be generated by the Evolven Change Analytics Server. The 
reports are sent when a risky change or drift is detected in a particular PCF environment or 
across multiple environments.
